Quiz
1. Declaring with var allows the variable to be redeclared later. You can't do that with let. Variables declared with var have function scope, while variables declared with let have block scope.
2. Declaring with const doesn't let a variable be redeclared OR reassigned, whereas declaring with var allows both reassignment and redeclaring. Variables declared with const also have block scope like variables declared with let, whereas variables declared with var have function scope.
3. Let allows variables to be reassigned, whereas const doesn't allow variables to be reassigned or redeclared.
4. Hoisting is when a variable is declared with var, and you can access the undefined declared variable in the code before it is initialized because var declarations happen before the rest of the code runs. The variable is "hoisted" to the top of the scope where they are declared.
